Absolutely, let's build this together! You're building a **SaaS for managing and scheduling social media posts**, something like a mix of Buffer, Hootsuite, and Notion for content creators and marketing teams. Let’s start with the **side navigation (sidenav) structure** – it should be clean, functional, and scalable.
